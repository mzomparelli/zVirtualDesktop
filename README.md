It's preferable to run directly from the `Startup` folder

You can get to the `Startup` folder by typing `Startup` into the address bar of any Windows Explorer window. Simply copy the file into that folder.

__Features:__

__Hotkeys:__

These are the default hotkeys. You can configure these any way you'd like.

__Navigate Desktops:__  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>NumberKeys</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>LEFT</kbd> or <kbd>RIGHT</kbd> - this is Windows Default and can be overridden to allow "Round Robin"   

__Move Windows:__  
The foreground window will be the window which moves  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>NumberKeys</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>LEFT</kbd> or <kbd>RIGHT</kbd>

__Move Window & Follow:__  
The foreground window will be the window which moves  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>NumberKeys</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>LEFT</kbd> or <kbd>RIGHT</kbd>

__Pin/Unpin Windows:__  
The foreground window will be the window which is pinned  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>

__Pin/Unpin Applications:__  
The foreground window will be the window which is pinned  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>

__What is the difference between pin app and pin window?__  
An easy way to imagine this is if you use `pin window` on a chrome browser window, 
only that window will be visible on all desktops. Any other chrome windows would 
stay on a single desktop. If you were to `pin application` on a chrome window then 
all chrome windows would show up on all desktops. This includes new chrome windows.

__System Tray Icon:__  
-Choose from several sets of icons  
-The icons indicate which desktop you are viewing  
-`Left-Click` the system tray icon to bring up the default Task View overlay.  
-`Double-Left-Click` the system tray icon to show the settings form.  
-`Right-Click` the system tray icon to bring up the main menu. You can donate to me in this menu since you love this app :)

Make your own icons and attach them to an issue then I will add them to the program.  
[How to submit icon files](https://github.com/mzomparelli/zVirtualDesktop/issues/23)

Download the current icons and alter ones you like. I ask that you come up with a name for your icon theme.

__Wallpapers:__  
-Set a different wallpaper for each desktop  
-Specify the style for each (Center, Stretch, or Tile)

__Desktop Names:__  
-Rename desktops directly in DesktopView

__Move All Windows__  
I added a really handy feature which you can also create a hotkey for.
This feature lets you move all open windows across all desktops to the currently active desktop.
